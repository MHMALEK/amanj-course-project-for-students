### Description

What We gonna develop? it's a Movie database website with React. the main page must include a header, a footer and in top of page it must be a togglable search bar that user can search movies by names and see the results.
it also should show some popular movies by default in the first page. after user click on the movie name, it should show  him/her the movie details in new page. for example /movies/:title.
for the Data, you can use your favorite api to get movies data. there are lots of free options too choose in here. I can recommend you [themoviedb]( https://www.themoviedb.org/) that is free and have every feature you might need.
Design is absolutley have some points here. not only design, but a good UX too. so try to implement something that is really usable as a reall production-ready app. for example if you want to implement search, use auto-fill search. add some transtition and hover effects and everything else that you might find interesting, will be a good point for us too:)
